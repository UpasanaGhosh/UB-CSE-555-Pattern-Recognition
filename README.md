# UB-CSE-555-Pattern-Recognition
This repository consists of the coding assignments that were assigned to us as a part of the CSE-555 Pattern Recognition course.
The description and instructions to run each of the projects are as follows:

#### Assignment 1: Bayesian Decision Theory and Fisher Digits
We need to download and keep the MNIST digit dataset ready for the Jupyter notebook to run. 
The data set is divided and named as follows:
1. t10k-images-idx3-ubyte
2. t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte
3. train-images-idx3-ubyte
4. train-labels-idx1-ubyte

Google collab was used for running this notebook but Anaconda would also work just fine.
